This program takes user inputs and generates a short but simple description explaining the concept to the user. It is great for summarizing information and is a useful learning supplement. To use this, you need valid Api Keys from https://openai.com/ and https://portal.lasercateyes.com/. Update your api keys and have them ready to insert into ApiSettings.json.

Enjoy!
